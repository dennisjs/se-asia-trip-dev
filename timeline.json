But we were rewarded with beautiful jungle scenery and rice paddies, an amazing waterfall, and finally the tribal village of the Karen people.

The mosquitos were there but not too hectic.  Incredible scenery all around us.  We visited an elephant 'sanctuary' which really is just a money generating business where the elephants are paraded in front of you in close proximity.  Not my favorite sort of enterprise but it was a treat to see an Asian elephant up so close.  Then we went on a river float on bamboo rafts.  Very peaceful with some gentle rapids and a very nice finish to another arduous day.  Look for photo icons to the SW of Chiang Mai if you're interested in seeing where this trek was.",

Pai, as I'm discovering is very, very much a young person town.  And when people say it's a hippie place they really just mean it's a place for getting high.  O guess I should have realized but I just assumed that was like a part of it while I think it's really the main part of it.  So...  I still need to see what kinds of activities more my speed are available - that's my job tomorrow.  I may only be here 3 nights or so - we'll see.",

There was a gallery of his stuff that was also incredible.  And the big bonus was a section I missed the first time called The Art Cave (or Art Garden - I think Cave...).  Just phenomenal.  This cave had so much detail with cool lighting, sculptures, music.  I found it hard to leave.  Then we hit the Blue Temple - another very cool, very modern temple not too dissimilar from the White Temple style.  Then the Black House or something like that which was an artist's (since passed) installation on this large property.  A lot of dark themes and unusual furniture and sculptures.  Another great installation.  Then to the tea farm which was pretty neato - Oolong tea tasting on a beautiful property.  Then the Tall Neck Village - which honestly was a little uncomfortable - but these people rely on this income as they are refugees from Myanmar.  You've surely seen at some point a documentary where the women of this tribe wear brass rings stacked on their necks that elongates them.  The older women still had these as did a few of the younger ones.  Felt weird taking pics so I didn't.  It was nice as there wasn't really a crowd and children were around playing their normal children games so the vibe was mostly fine.  Then the Golden Triangle which is the intersection of Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos.  Oh, and the Opium Museum which was sorta interesting - especially in that the area we spent most of the day in used to be predominantly occupied by opium fields.  Finally a quick stop at the Saturday Night Market in Chiang Rai, which I can still hear as I type this right before bed.  I have a very early morning tomorrow as I start my journey to Laos.  Should be an interesting one and it just might not be all that enjoyable.  Let's see how it goes!",

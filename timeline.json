The mosquitos were there but not too hectic.  Incredible scenery all around us.  We visited an elephant 'sanctuary' which really is just a money generating business where the elephants are paraded in front of you in close proximity.  Not my favorite sort of enterprise but it was a treat to see an Asian elephant up so close.  Then we went on a river float on bamboo rafts.  Very peaceful with some gentle rapids and a very nice finish to another arduous day.  Look for photo icons to the SW of Chiang Mai if you're interested in seeing where this trek was.",

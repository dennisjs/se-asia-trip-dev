But we were rewarded with beautiful jungle scenery and rice paddies, an amazing waterfall, and finally the tribal village of the Karen people.

The mosquitos were there but not too hectic.  Incredible scenery all around us.  We visited an elephant 'sanctuary' which really is just a money generating business where the elephants are paraded in front of you in close proximity.  Not my favorite sort of enterprise but it was a treat to see an Asian elephant up so close.  Then we went on a river float on bamboo rafts.  Very peaceful with some gentle rapids and a very nice finish to another arduous day.  Look for photo icons to the SW of Chiang Mai if you're interested in seeing where this trek was.",

It's a fairly dangerous 2-lane road to Pai, filled with huge trucks and blind turns and it rained during the 2nd half so it was a little but of a knuckle-biter.  Pai, as I'm discovering is very, very much a young person town.  And when people say it's a hippie place they really just mean it's a place for getting high.  O guess I should have realized but I just assumed that was like a part of it while I think it's really the main part of it.  So...  I still need to see what kinds of activities more my speed are available - that's my job tomorrow.  I may only be here 3 nights or so - we'll see.",

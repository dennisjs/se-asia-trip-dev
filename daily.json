    "description":  "2 dumb and trivial things that happened yesterday:\\n\\n* HKK (Hong Kong) airport:\\n  I wish I was clear-headed enough to capture a video but here’s the dumb & trivial thing:  Middle of the terminal, I see this cute-in-a-Scooby-Do-Velma way young woman pull away from her family and start to scope the area.  She chats with her Mom (?), motioning from her camera towards the airport gate.  She props up the phone on the ground and has her Mother & Auntie in the near distance.  There was almost no discussion - surely they’ve done this before or her convincing is most impressive.  The moms begin a fake conversation as they show each other their phones while cute-Velma is out of scene.  She walks up and motions to her phone pointing in the direction of the camera.  Then she scampers off toward the camera, make a big production out of jumping over the propped up camera-phone.  Two takes.  The 2nd one with a few variations.  End scene.\\n\\n* Even though I’ve spent a decent amount of time in Thailand, I failed to remember how the Rideshares work here.  Cash is an option - or maybe the only option? - though I was thinking it was like Uber/Lyft with electronic deduction.  Thus I didn’t grab any Thai money because I figured I’d do that the next day.  Get to my hotel and driver is asking me for cash.  Confused me wasn’t really understanding but then panic set in once I realized I had no way to pay my driver.  She was getting frustrated - rightfully so.  I looked up in despair and 33 degrees to my left I saw an ATM sign in the window.  Phew - went over & got the money - then she said she couldn’t break a 1000 Baht bill.  Went into the lobby and they broke it for me.  Gave her a good tip even though they don’t really tip here.  Dumb tourists."

    "description": "This is one of my favorite photos from my prior trip to the south of Thailand, taken on the island of Koh Lipe.  These women were doing the standard SE Asia thing of taking photos with with exotic, Insta-poses.  I have a collection of several of these haha.  I ran into these ladies a few days later as we were waiting for a boat to the mainland, and gave them a copy of the pic.  This turned out to be quite the journey as our crew decided to journey in the middle of a squall, upon which both of our motors promptly died in the middle of these massive waves.  They managed to get one of them barely going and we found moderate shelter in the shadow of an island nearby.  People getting sick everywhere as we waited 2 hours for rescue.  Unexpected adventures is part of the reason for travel!\\n\\n Where is Koh Lipe you ask?  Here's a fun map to show you.  I stayed at the Ten Moons Lipe Resort (upper right of map - final frame) - it was amazing and the pic was taken a very short distance outside my door."

    "description": "First an ANNOUNCEMENT:  I will be off the grid tomorrow as I'll be out in the jungle (it's a guided thing so no worries).  It should be interesting and I'll be sure to post about it assuming I survive - wouldn't that be something if these were my last public words hahaha - no really, I'll be fine.\\n\\n FYI, this is a video - see the Play button at the bottom?  \\n\\nI showed up at Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai at about 8am and there was not a single tourist in sight.  Just monks moving about the grounds doing whatever it is they do.  Had just gotten to the huge 15th century temple part of the property when the loudspeaker started broadcasting this chanting monk.  Or maybe it was the janitor - not sure.  This kind of moment is gold.  Not just for the experience - which truly was sublime - but also, I might be able to do something with the audio in a music production hahaha.\\n\\n Speaking of music production, I haven't found the time to dig into that yet but plan to.  I've been spending some of my spare time with this AV tool called TouchDesigner - it will take some time to learn but it offers up the capability of audio-reactive art / graphics.  So that sounds like fun to me and I hope to post something up here before too long."
